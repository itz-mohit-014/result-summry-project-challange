## My process

I make a block in html that will wrappe all the content inside and give it styling and then I design the result section block and gradually I make the summary section.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Basically this whole project is made by using flexbox layout and the thing is keep in mind in flexbox layout is that...

**how to flex item should be align so that it can look closer that was the shown in the challenge**

To see I prepaird the whole design using flexbox layout... added code snippets, see below:

```html
<section id="wrapper">
  
<div class="items">
  .... content or we can add more element inside it ...
</div>
<div class="items">
  .... content or we can add more element inside it ...
</div>
<div class="items">
  .... content or we can add more element inside it ...
</div>
</section>
```

```css

#wrapper {
  display:flex;
  justify-content:center;
  align-items:center;
}

```
